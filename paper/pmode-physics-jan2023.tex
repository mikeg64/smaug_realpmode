\section{Introduction}

Theoretical and computational studies coupled with observations from solar telescopes, {\bf both from ground or space}, reveal diverse structures and dynamics in the Sun's atmosphere. The culmination of these studies of the {\bf chromosphere} and the upper solar atmosphere has enhanced our knowledge of the variety of magnetic field structures.  Despite our armoury of observations and the diverse range of computational models it still remains a challenge to make sense of this complex menagerie of dynamical structures, understand solar atmospheric heating (i.e. chromospheric and coronal) and more generally space weather phenomena.


An example of the dynamical complexity are the ubiquitous five-minute oscillations in the {\bf lower} solar atmosphere {\bf (i.e., in particular in the photsophere)} that are referred to as the solar global acoustic oscillations or $p$-modes. These global oscillations are interpreted as trapped acoustic waves, i.e. standing acoustic oscillations of the solar interior. Earlier models of these oscillations assumed that there was reflection by the photosphere with at most evanescent propagation above the photosphere. The $p$-modes were interpreted as resonant modes trapped in a cavity formed from the steep change in density at the solar surface and a lower turning point in the interior caused by the increase in the speed of sound resulting in refraction. The physical characteristics of the solar sub-surface layers can be estimated using observations of the standing modes. {\bf There is now increasing evidence for leakage of these modes.} The complexity and variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere {\bf give} rise to a mixture of waves providing powerful diagnostics to aid our understanding and advance our knowledge {\bf about these structures}.

Early theoretical studies reported {\bf e.g.} in \citet{Roberts1981a} and \citet{Roberts1981b} considered wave propagation in idealised magnetic slab structures, demonstrating the fundamental conditions for {\bf magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)} wave propagation. These models were soon advanced to cylindrical magnetic structures in \citet{EdwinandRoberts1983} that addressed 
%the conditions under 
which different types of MHD waves can be sustained under the conditions of the solar corona. These papers neglected gravitational stratification and focused on magnetic structuring. There was also an emphasis on the localised wave phenomena.  The analysis of \citet{Campbell1989} investigated the role of horizontal chromospheric magnetic fields for magneto-acoustic modes. As well as finding the shift of frequencies they were also able to predict the circumstances under which different chromospheric regions would either act as a window permitting the propagation of magneto-acoustic energy,  a sink where the energy is trapped or reflected back into the chromosphere. The propagation of magneto-acoustic oscillations in an isothermal atmosphere with a vertical magnetic field was investigated by \citet{Hindman1996} although small frequency shifts were accounted for, the analysis was unable to demonstrate the absorption of MHD waves,  e.g. what is observed in sunspots. Much of the {\bf early} theoretical (numerical) {\bf analyses} {\bf have} focused on the effect of magnetic flux tubes on wave propagation and neglected gravitational stratification. \citet{Hasan1992} considered an isothermal stratified atmosphere and investigated the influence of vertical fields on a variety of modes, including $p$-mode oscillations. In the limit of weak fields, they were able to analyse the spectrum of oscillations in using the modes for a non-magnetised stratified atmosphere and the slow magneto-acoustic mode.  The characteristics of generated waves are dependent on the motions at the footpoints of magnetic field concentrations, including those in the intergranular lanes. For example, vortex motions have been demonstrated to generate Alfv\'en waves \citet{Fedun2009b}.   


%FIXME
%EXPLAIN IMPORTANCCE OF GLOBAL VERSUS LOCAL PHENOMENA HIGHLIGHT IN PAPER WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COUPLED ATMOSPHERE
%UPDATE
The link between oscillations in the solar atmosphere and solar global oscillations, {\bf what is} the topic of the computational modelling work described in this paper, is addressed by \citet{Erdelyi2006}. This paper views the photosphere, chromosphere and transition layer as a boundary layer coupling the solar interior and the solar corona. It considers how boundary layers may result in frequency shifts of global oscillations and how it influences the coupling of the internal oscillations with the solar atmosphere. \\
%UPDATE
An outward propagating wave is reflected inward from the solar upper surface, or boundary layer, because of a sudden decrease in the plasma density, while the lower boundary of the cavity is formed by the increasing sound speed due to temperature rises. For global oscillation modes which exceed the acoustic cutoff frequency, there is wave leakage out from the cavity into the atmosphere. A model for understanding the behaviour of solar global oscillations based on the Klein-Gordon equation was {\bf further} developed by \citet{Taroyan2008}. This model suggests a global resonance. Waves {\bf that} are normally trapped by a frequency cut-off barrier are enhanced by a resonance enabling propagation into the upper solar atmosphere. The inhomogeneous three-layer model leads to characteristic frequencies. Enhancements to the models described earlier are presented by e.g. \citet{Pinter2007},  their work utilised an exponentially decaying horizontal magnetic field as a representation of the magnetic carpet. 
 
 For a number of decades, intensity oscillations in the solar atmosphere have been the subject of observation and study, see {\bf e.g. the reviews} \citet{Banerjee2011}, \citet{deMoortel2009}, \citet{Mathioudakis2013}, \citet{Ruderman2009}, \citet{Wang2011}. The observed periods of atmospheric intensity oscillations range from {\bf a few} seconds to several hours \citet{Auchere2014}. Much earlier, it was proposed by \citet{Jensen1963}, that the 3- and 5-minute oscillations were the characteristics of the photosphere and the chromosphere. Recently, the association of intensity oscillations with oscillations in coronal loops and sunspots has been confirmed for oscillation periods of three minutes. Applying solar magneto-seismology, observations of intensity observations in the solar atmosphere can be used to understand the magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere, see e.g. \citet{Roberts1984}, \citet{Banerjee2007}, \citet{Zaqarashvili2007}, \citet{Erdelyi2008}, \citet{Verth2010}.  Additionally, it has been {\bf suggested} that the 5-minute oscillations in loops {\bf may} not related to sunspots \citet{deMoortel2002}. Evidence for global oscillations {\b in the chromosphere, corona} is suggested by the observational analysis of \citet{Gyenge2018} {\bf demonstrating} that the frequent recurrence of micro-flare events exhibit fluctuations between 3 minutes and 12 minutes. These fluctuations arise during time intervals before and after major solar flares.


The key point of this work is a comparison of numerical simulations {\bf of a simplified solar atmosphere} with observations, searching for a {\bf potential} link between ubiquitous upper atmospheric oscillations and the global solar oscillations. We use a {\bf simple} numerical representation that is of sufficient complexity to reveal the dominant dynamical processes in the magnetic solar atmosphere. Comparison of the reported observational work with the results of the modelling provides an indication that the modelling is sufficiently complex to give an insight into the physical mechanisms behind the solar global oscillations. We report the results of numerical simulations of photospheric $p$-mode oscillations in a model solar atmosphere with a uniform and vertical magnetic field. We also present the results of a temporal analysis based on observations of intensity oscillations with the objective of providing evidence of the existence of the temporal behaviour exhibited by our simulations. The work contributes to our understanding of the propagation and modification of global oscillations in the highly gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere. 



First, we consider the variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and study the wave motions that are observed in these regions. This is followed with a description of the solar atmospheric model, magnetic field configuration and the simulation method we {\bf use} to {\bf compute} global oscillations in a 
%model 
magnetic solar atmosphere.

\section{Structures in the Solar Atmosphere}

\label{sec:structures}

%RE: i suggest to remove this: 
%With the objective of constructing a simplified model solar atmosphere we now {\bf very briefly recall} some of the structures which are {\bf actually} observed. The highly dynamic solar chromosphere exhibits numerous structures. Bright spots {\bf that} form in the trenches between solar granules are known as faculae, these features which are formed near magnetic field concentrations constantly form and dissipate over time scales of several minutes. Pores are a few Mm across and they are the smaller counterparts of sunspots, they are the bright areas near to and around sunspots or faculae. The bright areas that extend away from active regions are called plage regions.  The magnetic fields in this area diffuse away into the quiet Sun regions. The magnetic network is a network of lines which outline super-granules. Super-granules are convective regions about 30~Mm across, and they possess strong horizontal flows. The motions within the super-granules result in the concentration of bundles of magnetic field lines.  
%

%The picture shows the coronal funnels arising from grain boundaries, it also illustrates a range of network loops with temperatures which can be in the range $10^{5}$K to $10^{6}$K. As well as these massive concentrations, the solar magnetogram at the base of the model reveals many north poles in the quiet photosphere, known as the magnetic carpet.  
}
%\caption{Initial Magnetic Field Configuration, radial field distribution, uniform in the vertical direction with a maximum value of 100G }
\end{figure}

The mean photospheric field in the inter-network region is 100-300 G. 
%Solar active regions contain sunspots which have sizes between  1 - 50 Mm. 
{\bf On the other hand}, active regions{\bf, containing sunspots that have sizes between  1 - 50 Mm, produce} flares {\bf that} may have fields easily {\bf exceeding} the %normal 
range of 100-500 G. As well as these massive concentrations, solar magnetograms reveal 
%many north poles in the quiet photosphere, this is known as 
{\bf a weak-field component, known as} the magnetic carpet. These structures are {\bf schematically} illustrated in Figure 1. Along with the coronal funnels arising from grain boundaries, the picture shows a {\bf variety} of network loops with temperatures {\bf that}  can be in the range $10^{5}$K to $10^{6}$K. The {\bf dynamic} phenomena of concern in this paper result in {\bf upward} waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere. 
%The upward propagation of waves through the solar atmosphere can result in coronal heating, frequency shifts and other wave phenomena. 
A {\bf spectrum} of wave transformation {\bf and interaction} may occur including reflection and refraction by atmospheric structures. 


Our initial computational studies were applicable to quiet Sun regions with magnetic fluxes in the range of 5-10 G, including the non-magnetic solar chromosphere and the quiet inter-network regions between the magnetic flux concentrations. Given the variety of solar atmospheric regions, for example the network, inter network, plage and faculae regions, it is recognised that the modes of oscillation with periods of 3 and 5 minutes exhibit varying behaviour. The variation observed for different magnetic structures and reflecting layers such as the transition layer influences propagation in the upward and downward directions.


The power spectra presented in the first figure of \citet{Griffiths2018b} exhibit a variation of propagation characteristics at different levels within the solar atmosphere and within different regions such as coronal holes, the Quiet Sun and active regions. The power spectra indicate a preponderance of long period 5 minute waves with frequencies in the range 1.5-5 mHz. Also observed are the distinctive peaks for the short period 3 minute waves (with frequencies in the range 5-8 mHz). The power spectra exhibit {\bf also} peaks in much longer period ranges for example 12-minute waves  (frequencies in the range 1.1-1.5 mHz)  and 16-minute waves (frequencies 1-1.1 mHz). For the Quiet Sun regions the 5 minute modes are stronger at photospheric levels and diminished higher up in the corona, but note a small peak for the data from the AIA 211 corresponding to 2.0MK. 



The review of \citet{Khomenko2013} summarises this multifaceted picture. In the close proximity of the magnetic network elements, the longer 5-minute modes propagate efficiently to the chromosphere. The 3-minute modes propagate from the photosphere to the chromosphere in the network cell interiors for restricted regions of the network and internetwork. Although these long-period halos are present in the chromosphere they are most prominent in the photosphere. With their more complex magnetic structures, a more intervened pattern is exhibited in plage and faculae regions. Observations show that the 3-minute modes exhibit enhancement in both photosphere and chromosphere whereas the power of the 5-minute modes increase significantly in the chromosphere. These power enhancements are known as “halos” and have been widely reported \citet{Kontogiannis2010}.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Given the complexity of the dynamics and the diversity of structures in the solar atmosphere, it is understood that a truly realistic model is challenging and {\bf require} a hybrid multi-disciplined approach. {\bf A computational MHD simulation} of the propagation of waves in 3D solar atmospheres {\bf was} undertaken by \citet{Fedun2009a}. Initially they considered hydrodynamical models. {\bf In later simulations, }
\citet{Fedun2009b} \citet{Vigeesh2012} reported results for magnetized solar atmospheres featuring an idealized flux tube. These models with point drivers demonstrated the leakage of magneto-acoustic energy into the solar atmosphere. Many computational MHD simulations of the Sun have been undertaken, some of the approaches have resulted in an encouraging degree of realism  \citet{Vogler2005}, \citet{Gudiksen2011}.  The work of \citet{Khomenko2013} and  \citet{Santamaria2015} reviewed and presented 2D computational MHD modelling of wave propagation in magnetic features such as sunspots and arcades.

In order to develop a model providing a representation of the solar atmosphere it is necessary to establish that the modelling tools give a consistent behaviour in idealised test cases and that there is a consistency between the computational and theoretical models. {\bf Following this principle, an earlier} work tested the SMAUG code with hydrodynamic models with drivers representing the standing $p$-mode oscillations, see \citet{Griffiths2018b}. A standing mode driver that does not possess any buffeting behaviour, is placed just above the base of the model and mimics the evanescent $p$-mode oscillation. The study does not consider non-linear effects because the driver we have employed is linear.


%FIXME
%BUFFETING VERSUS VERTICAL MOTIONS USE THE WORD REALISTIC WITH CAUTION

%VERTICAL MOTIONS EXCITE ACOUSTIC MODES ONLY HOW ARE OTHER MODES EXCITED WHY STANDING MODE DRIVER WHY NOT A PROPAGATING DRIVER... THIS RELATES TO GLOBAL OSCILLATIONS HOW IMPORTANT ARE NON LINEAR EFFECTS... THIS IS UNCRERTAIN WOULD BE SUBJECT OF EXTENSION OF WORK

%UPDATE
 

The models reveal that vertical magnetic fields enable energy to reach the corona e.g. see  \citet{Khomenko2013} and  \citet{Santamaria2015}. Our initial models of a stratified solar atmosphere \citet{Griffiths2018b} were hydrodynamic simulations. In these simulations, atmospheric perturbations caused by photospheric global oscillations are represented using drivers located in the photosphere so as to mimic the influence of the solar $p$-modes. The results of the hydrodynamic modelling exhibited agreement  with the energy flux predictions from a 2 layer {\bf analytical model based on the Klein-Gordon equation}. This agreement supported the interpretation of the interaction between the solar atmosphere and the global oscillations. Also revealed by the simulations  was a consistency between power flux measurements from SDO and frequency dependent energy flux measurements from the numerical simulations. This observed propagation of energy into the mid to upper atmospheric regions of the Quiet Sun occurred for a range of frequencies. Such observations may explain the observed intensity oscillations for periods greater than the well-known 5-minute and 3-minute oscillations. It was also found that energy flux propagation into the lower solar corona is strongly dependent on the particular wave modes. In this paper, we present the results of investigation into the leakage of energy into the solar atmosphere using 3D numerical MHD simulations with an extended driver representing solar global oscillations. 




\section{Numerical Computation Methods}


The simulations described in this paper were undertaken using the SMAUG code, a GPU implementation of the Sheffield Advanced Code (SAC) \citet{Shelyag2008}. The Sheffield MHD Accelerated Using GPUs (SMAUG) \citet{Griffiths2015} and SAC  are derived from the versatile advection code (VAC) developed by \citet{Toth1996}. SAC and SMAUG are numerical MHD solvers {\bf that} can be used to model the time-dependent evolution of photospheric oscillations in the solar atmosphere. The SMAUG code can simulate linear and non-linear wave propagation in strongly magnetised plasma with structuring and stratification.

We use the 
%same 
general system of ideal MHD equations applicable to an ideal compressible plasma and used for our initial hydrodynamic simulations, \citet{Griffiths2018b}.
\begin{eqnarray}
&& {{\partial \rho}\over{\partial t}}+\nabla\cdot\left( \rho{\mathbf v}\right)=0, \label{e1} \\
&& {{\partial ( \rho {\bf v})}\over{\partial t}}+\nabla\cdot\left( {\bf v}\rho {\bf v}-{\bf B B}\right)+\nabla p_t=\rho{\bf g}, \label{e2}\\
&& \frac{\partial e}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\left({\bf v}e-{\bf B B}\cdot{\bf v}+{\bf v}p_{t}\right)+\nabla p_t=\rho{\bf g}\cdot{\bf v}, \label{e3} \\
&& {{\partial{\bf B}}\over{\partial t}} +\nabla \cdot\left(  {\bf vB}-{\bf Bv}\right)=0. \label{e4}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
The total pressure $p_{t}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
p_{t}=p_{k}+{{\bf B}^{2}\over{2}}, \label{e5}
\end{equation}
and the kinetic pressure, $p_k$, is written as
\begin{equation}
p_{k}=\left(\gamma -1\right)\left(e-\frac{\rho {\mathbf v}^{2}}{2}-\frac{{\mathbf B}^{2}}{2}\right). \label{e6}
\end{equation}

In the system of equations above,  $\mathbf B$ is the magnetic field, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity, $\rho$ is the mass density, $\mathbf g$ is the gravitational acceleration vector  and  $\it{e}$ is the energy density. The SMAUG code used for the simulations reported here employs perturbed versions of the general set of MHD equations given above. For the perturbed versions the density,  energy density and magnetic field are expressed in terms of perturbed and background quantities as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \rho = \tilde{\rho}+\rho_b, \nonumber \\
&& e = \tilde{e}+e_b,  \nonumber \\
&& {\mathbf B} = \tilde{\mathbf B}+{\mathbf B}_b.  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Assuming a magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium of the background plasma, the background quantities {\bf that} do not change in time have a subscript $\it{b}$. The time varying perturbed quantities do not have a subscript. The fully non-linear MHD numerical finite element solver employs hyper-diffusion and hyper-resistivity to achieve numerical stability of the computed solution of the MHD equations \citet{Caunt2001}. A more detailed description of the full set of MHD equations, including the hyper-diffusion source terms are given in \citet{Griffiths2015} and \citet{Shelyag2008}.

\section{Computational Model}
The hydrodynamic studies reported in  \citet{Griffiths2018b} employed simulation drivers with physical characteristics representing $p$-mode oscillations with varying modes and periods. The MHD simulations reported here use the same driver and model of the solar atmosphere as used in our initial hydrodynamic study. The model is {\bf advanced} by the inclusion of a uniform, vertical and cylindrically symmetric magnetic field. 

 The dimensions of the simulation box are $L_{ x}= 4$ Mm,  $L_{y} =4$ Mm and with a height of $L_{z} =6$ Mm in the gravitationally stratified $z$-direction. The computational box is an array of elements $128 \times128 \times128 $. The upper boundary of the model is in the solar corona whilst the lower boundary is coincident with the photosphere. The perturbed MHD code used here is suited to studying the propagation of wave energy from the photosphere, across the transition layer and leaking into the solar corona. 
 
 %UPDATE
%INCLUDE DETAILS ABOUT THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS
The time scales relevant to our study are determined by the 5-minute $p$-mode oscillations, the model employs boundary conditions allowing us to model induced wave propagation. To generate these oscillations we use vertical velocity drivers {\bf that} are extended across the base of the model. The mechanism for handling the boundaries is crucial for maintaining the stability of a simulation over many cycles of the p-mode oscillation. The challenge is to reduce the reflectivity at the boundaries, in particular, the upper and lower boundaries. The method utilised in these simulations attempts to minimise the gradients near the boundary. Since a central difference method is used to compute the gradients, variable values are copied from the mesh edge into two layers of ghost cells. These layers ensure that the discretization method can be applied over the whole mesh. The net result of this approach is that any generated perturbation will be effectively propagated out of the computational domain. This type of boundary condition is referred to as an open boundary condition. The following sections describe the model solar atmosphere and the driver.
 %UPDATE

Data obtained from solar observations were used to construct a semi-empirical model solar atmosphere, the resulting model is a representation of the Quiet Sun. Employing the fundamental assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, the VALIIIc model \citet{Vernazza1981} was used to construct a model of the chromosphere in equilibrium. For atmospheric heights greater than 2.5 Mm the results from a model of solar coronal heating were used \citet{McWhirter1975}. The atmospheric profiles for temperature, density, sound speed and frequency cut-off for this model are shown in figure 3 and 4.
%\ref{soundspeedVAL3C_profile_fig1R}. 
A further possibility for a model solar atmosphere is the use of parametric models, the smoothed step function used by \citet{Murawski2010} is an example. Discussion of the validity of model solar atmospheres and realistic models of the chromosphere,  indicate the need for observationally derived semi-empirical models, see \citet{Carlsson1995}, \citet{Kalkofen2012}. It has been suggested that local dynamo action and joule heating in the dynamical solar chromosphere make the construction of models particularly challenging \citet{Leenaarts2011}.


For the simulations described here, we use a simplistic model {\bf that} is uniform in the vertical ($z$) direction. The cylindrically symmetric field was constructed using  the parametrisation in equation \ref{e7}, the effective cylinder radius was fixed at $R=0.14$Mm. Simulations were run for different values of $B_{max}$.

\begin{equation}
B_{z}=B_{max} e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{R^2}}. \label{e7}
\end{equation}

%WHY A CYLINDRICAL FIELD?
A field configuration with vertical cylindrical symmetry is selected as this provides a working, e.g. rotational symmetry, representation for {\bf the weaker intranetwork magnetic field}.

%RE: if we have 50 G, that is far too weak for a pore. i siggest to delete this:
%a solar pore.    A good discussion of the structure of  solar pores can be found in \citet{Simon1970}, \citet{Cameron2007}.
Since the field is uniform in the vertical direction the model atmosphere is in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. This was checked by ensuring that the initial configuration satisfies the magnetohydrostatic balance, for an example see \citet{Schussler2005}, \citet{Gent2013}. We also explicitly tested that the there were no dynamic changes in the model due to a magnetohydrostatic imbalance. The resulting density and temperature profiles are shown in Figure 3. 


\section{Numerical Drivers for $p$-mode Oscillations}

The work reported here is an extension of the earlier work of \citet{Malins2007}, their study represented photospheric $p$-mode oscillations using different point drivers. These studies demonstrated {\bf the generation of} surface waves, structures in the transition zone and identified the effect of cut-offs induced by the stratified  solar atmosphere. The {\bf brief} overview in Section 2 identified physical phenomena delivering energy into the solar atmosphere and resulting in oscillatory behaviour. 

The simulations presented in this paper, employ an extended driver resulting in the perturbation of the entire lower boundary of the model.  Photospheric $p$-mode oscillations {\bf observed for on the Sun} have a horizontal wavelength and coherence. The vertical velocity driver used here is an acoustic $p$-mode driver located at the photosphere and exciting waves which propagate 
into our realistic 3D model of the solar atmosphere. An extended driver with a sinusoidal dependence and a wavelength of 8 Mm applied along the middle of the base of a computational domain of dimension 4 Mm represents  a {\it fundamental mode} {\bf component of the global acoustic oscillations}. Drivers may be constructed as an ensemble of these solar global eigenmodes. The driver is represented by the expression shown in equation (\ref{e8}) 


%%\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\begin{equation}
 V_{z}  =  A_{nm} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_s} \right)\sin\left(  \frac{(n+1)\pi x}{L_x} \right)  
 \sin\left(\frac{(m+1)\pi y}{L_y} \right) \exp\left( -\frac{(z-z_0)^2}{\Delta z^2} \right),
\label{e8}
\end{equation}
%%\end{tabular}

For the  simulations here, a $p$-mode driver corresponding to the 5-minute mode, was used with period 300 s and mode (2,2). Earlier studies demonstrated the effectiveness of this mode with energy propagation, see \citet{Griffiths2018b}. Simulations were run for different values of the magnitude of the magnetic field. The mode numbers identified here are the $n$ and $m$ values in the expression for the driver shown in Equation (\ref{e8}).

For the driver equation given in Eq.~\ref{e8}, $T_{s}$ is the period, $A_{nm}$ is the amplitude, the indices $n$ and $m$ define the mode, the lengths of the base of the simulation box in the $x$ and $y$ directions are $L_{x}$ and $L_{y}$ are  respectively. The driver width, $\Delta z$ is set to $4$~km, the parameter $z_{0}$ was set so that the vertical location of the driver is in the photosphere, 0.5 Mm above the lower boundary of the model and coincident with the location of the temperature minimum. The simulations presented use the parameter $A_{nm}$=500\, ms$^{-1}$ with the mode indices set to $n,m=2$. 


\section{Global Magnetoacoustic Waves in Uniform Vertical Magnetic Field Configurations}

Magnetohydrodynamic simulations have been performed with $p$-mode oscillations of the photospheric layer and for magnetic field strengths of 0G, 50G, 75G and 100G. The plasma-$\beta$ was computed for the case with a magnetic field strength of 100G. The computed plasma-$\beta$ for the model decreases rapidly from a value of 50 at 0.7Mm above the lower boundary of the simulation domain, $\beta$ is 1 at a height of 1.39Mm.  
%It is anticipated that for the region with $\beta \approx 1$, mode conversion may occur. 

%FIXME

 illustrates a clear difference between the purely hydrodynamic and the MHD case. The figures for the MHD case exhibit evidence of a fast moving magneto-acoustic wave mode. The measured propagation speed is consistent with that of a fast magneto-acoustic mode. Figures 5 and 6 compare the wave modes at a quarter, half and three-quarters of a cycle. 

 A set of videos of all the simulations that were performed can be obtained from the online research data archive hosted by The University of Sheffield, \citet{Griffiths2018a} 
 %{\bf RE: pls provide a direct weblink here. MKG the refernce is a working direct link}. 
 The videos display the evolution of the $z$-component of the plasma velocity along different layers of our model solar atmosphere. Each video shows the value of the vertical component of the plasma velocity ($z$-component in m/s) along different slices through the simulation box. Each video is labelled using the magnetic field strength in Gauss. 
  %Figure 6 shows the normalised difference between the results for the 100G case and the 0G case. The normalisation is achieved by dividing the difference value  by the sum the sum of the values for the 0G and 100G case. The largest difference arises at the height where the velocity reverses direction.   
  
  Our results indicate that even a small magnetic field appears to enhance the motion of plasma in the corona and  there is an apparent difference in phase between the magnetic field cases. As well as an increase in the velocity amplitude with increasing magnetic field there is a small shift in the frequency of the oscillation. In order to fully explain the observed shift further investigative simulations would be required {\bf that} would include simulations running for a larger number of cycles. {\bf The key point here is that the background magnetic field is vertical, one may not accept any frequency shifts assuming a linear wave evolution is the key component to the physics. Since the simulations do show small frequency shifts, this may mean that that the linear theory may break.}
  %For magnetic fields with strengths between $1$ kG and $50$ G, the theoretical prediction of \citet{Hindman1996} resulted in frequency shifts in the microhertz and nanohertz range.  Although this was a prediction of helioseismology, their result still provides insight into the mechanism of frequency shifts of waves in atmospheric magnetic structures. 
  

%FIXME
%MENTION HERE WHY WE HAVE CUT THIS OFF AND REFERE TO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS OF REFLECTION

After much  effort implementing and testing  the chosen numerical scheme to solve the numerical equations there are still reflections at the boundary, therefore we consider the simulations to be valid up to the point where reflection occurs, because of this, the simulations are cut after approximately 600~s of real time corresponding to two period cycles.

A {\bf time-distance} plot for the 300~s period driver, with the 100~G field is shown in Figure 8. The reflections from the imperfect boundary conditions result in increased velocity amplitudes after a few oscillations. Although we are investigating the propagation of waves into the corona, the time-distance plots emphasises phenomena observed in the chromosphere and around the transition zone.  The waves speeds measured from this time-distance plot are shown in Table \ref{Tablewavespeeds_300s}. A comparison with the wave speeds computed from the model atmosphere suggests that, the speeds for the 0 G field are consistent with the speed of sound in the solar atmosphere, whilst the speeds for the non-zero magnetic field are consistent with propagation speeds for magnetosonic modes.
For a {\bf vertical} magnetic flux %tube 
with magnetic field strength $B_{0}$ and internal density $\rho_{0}$, comparisons with the measured wave speeds were computed using the following definitions:
the speed of sound,

\begin{equation}
 c_{s}  =    \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p_0}{\rho_0}}, 
\label{e10}
\end{equation}
the Alfvén speed,
\begin{equation}
 v_{A}  =    \sqrt{\frac{B_{0}^{2}}{\mu\rho_{0}}},  
\label{e11}
\end{equation}
the magneto-acoustic wave speeds, also known as  the slow or tube speed,
\begin{equation}
 c_{t}  =    \frac{c_s v_A}{\sqrt(c_s^2+v_A^2)}, 
\label{e12}
\end{equation}
and the kink speed,
\begin{equation}
 c_{k}  =    \sqrt{\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_0+\rho_e}}v_A.
\label{e12}
\end{equation}

The results indicate a variety of waves. Inspection of Figure 8 reveals excitation from the driver along with quasi standing oscillations in the chromospheric cavity. There is also partial reflection of the signal at the boundary of the chromosphere and the transition layer. The results also display evidence for signals propagating horizontally at the transition region and with frequencies similar to that of the driver. The time-distance plot in Figure 7, for the 100~G case, exhibits reduced reflection at the transition layer and indicating energy leakage into the solar corona. Figure 8 shows an initial fast mode pulse followed by slow mode oscillations above the line which corresponds to a plasma-$\beta$ with a value of one. Below the height of 1~Mm, we observe quasi-standing mode oscillations along with oscillations of the magnetic field perturbations. Below 0.3~Mm, the driver oscillations can be observed in conjunction with possible magneto-acoustic slow mode oscillations. Since the source terms perturb only the vertical component of the velocity and the model is cylindrically symmetric, pure Alfv\'en modes are not expected.

\end{figure}

The time-distance plots and our sections displaying the vertical component of the plasma velocity indicate significant differences in the propagation behaviour for the hydrodynamic and non-zero magnetic field cases. It is necessary to understand and quantify the extent of the energy leakage into the solar atmosphere. To investigate the influence of the magnetic field on the propagation of wave energy we employ an expression for the energy flux which was used by \citet{Bogdan2003}. The wave energy flux $\bf{F}_{wave}$ is given by
$$
{\mathbf F}_{wave}=\tilde{p}_{k} {\mathbf v}+\tilde{\mathbf B}\cdot {\mathbf B_{b}}{\mathbf v}+{\mathbf v}\cdot \tilde{\mathbf B}{\mathbf B_{b}} .
$$

We compute the time averaged energy flux integrated over different cross sections of the simulation box.

\begin{equation}
F_{int}= \frac{1}{t_{max}} \int_{0}^{t_{max}} \int {\mathbf F}_{wave} \cdot d{\mathbf A}dt,
\label{e11}
\end{equation}

These expressions are dependent on the perturbed kinetic pressure $\tilde{p}_{k}$.
$$
\tilde{p}_{k}=\left(\gamma - 1\right)\left( \tilde{e}-\frac{ \left( \tilde{\rho} +\rho_b \right){\mathbf v}^2}{2}-\frac{{\mathbf B}^2}{2}\right).
$$


Using Equation (\ref{e11}), we computed the energy flux integral for each of the drivers at different atmospheric heights and averaged over the total time. We compute the ratio of this integrated energy flux to the integrated energy flux at the location of the driver. The resulting values are shown in Table~2. It appears that for heights greater than 4~Mm, the energy flux is enhanced for increasing values for the vertical magnetic field. In Figure~9,
%\ref{energyfluxratio_50G_75G_100G_line},
we plot the ratio of the integrated energy flux ratio for different values of the field at different heights and for the different vertical field values (the blue, orange, purple and red  are for field values of 0~G, 50~G, 75~G and 100~G, respectively). These plots demonstrate that for higher $B$-field magnitudes there is a small leakage of energy propagation. This latter finding is interesting because this is consistent with observations and other simulation results that demonstrate an enhancement for inclined fields.

\section{Frequency Analysis}

{\bf We analyse the temporal behaviour of the numerical result, outlined in the previous section.} The top panel of Figure~10 shows a vertical slice of $Bz$ over time. {\bf The data is based on the simulation} with the initial magnetic field configuration with a maximum value of $100$~G. The vertical axis represents the height in Mm and the horizontal axis is the time dimension, measured in seconds. From this 2-dimensional plane, $5$ layers were selected, representing different heights in the solar atmosphere. The layers are indicated by the horizontal grey lines. {\bf  The middle panel of Figure~10 displays the temporal variation of the selected layers, indicated by different grey shade colours. An FFT was applied (the lower panel of Figure~10) for investigating any oscillatory behaviour in the analysed signal.} A significant oscillatory pattern was found with frequency range of $3.75$ - $4$mHz, corresponding to a period range of $4.2$ - $4.4$ minutes.{\bf A slight frequency shift is also recognisable. The different layers in height tend to feature shifted peaks in FFT.} An FFT was also performed based on the other simulations with different initial magnetic field configurations (with a maximum value of $0$~G , $50$~G,  $75$~G  and $100$~G). These investigations all showed similar oscillatory behaviour. {\bf Figure~11 features the same analysis as Figure~10, however, the study features a vertical slice of $Vz$ over time. The analysis shows similar properties as the data based on a vertical slice of $Bz$.}

With the objective of confirming the obtained oscillatory behaviour, temporal analysis for the observational data was performed. We investigated intensity oscillations in the solar atmosphere observed by SDO/AIA. The passband 1600 {\AA} was selected because our simulation mainly focused on the lower atmospheric regions, i.e. photosphere and chromosphere. The cadence of 1600 {\AA} images is 24 seconds, therefore it was suitable for studying relatively high-frequency oscillations such as the obtained $4$~mHz.

The initial magnetic field configuration of our model is a standing magnetic tube, passing through the chromosphere and the lower corona. {\bf Therefore, we randomly chose to sample a typical active region in a simplified way.} The  selected area contains a small sunspot (solar pore), presumably featuring similar magnetic structure as our simulation. The size of the investigated area covers 50 pixels in total between 18:00 UT to 20:00 UT on 22 August 2010, demonstrated by Figure 13. The obtained time series shows non-stationary behaviour, therefore, the observed linear trend is removed by taking the first difference $\Delta  y_{t}$ of the data. The first difference is defined as the difference between consecutive observations $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-1}$. Furthermore, the times series is also normalised by applying standard scores (Z-scores), defined by:


\begin{equation}
	Z_{i} = \frac {T_{i} - \overline{T}}  {\sigma(T)},
	\label{z_score}
\end{equation}


where, the parameter $\overline{T}$ is the mean of the time series and the parameter $\sigma(T)$ is defined as the standard deviation of the data. The top panel of Figure 12 demonstrates the trend removed and normalised time series. The lower panel of Figure~11 shows the result of the applied FFT technique. The dashed line is the significance level ($3 \sigma$) which was calculated using a Monte-Carlo method. The original data showed red noise signature which transformed to blue noise after differentiating the data. We have generated 1 million blue noise signatures $N_{b}$ and calculated the standard deviation $\sigma(N_{b})$ and the mean $\overline{N_{b}}$ of the simulated noise, providing our significance level $S$:


\begin{equation}
    S = \overline{N_{b}} + 3 \sigma(N_{b}).
\end{equation}


A significant period is found with frequency range of $3.5-4.2$ mHz , corresponding a period range of $4$ - $4.7$ minutes, which is close to the period found in simulation data. Another significant peak ($5$ mHz) is found with period around $3$ minutes which may be an indication of another global oscillation. {\bf This randomly selected region in the solar surface suggests that the observed oscillation is a global phenomenon.}


\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented results for a series of MHD simulations of an extended oscillator at the base of a model solar atmosphere. Building upon earlier {\bf studies} we {\bf here} extend the modelling to test how the SMAUG code works with an initially symmetric and uniform magnetic field.

We have shown that energy is propagated by magnetosonic modes. Slow and fast magnetosonic modes are responsible for carrying some energy back to the chromosphere and the photosphere. 
The FFT analysis demonstrated oscillatory patterns with periods in the range 4.2-4.4 minutes. This arose for both the hydrodynamic case and the case with a magnetic field of 100~G. In {\bf the latter} case there was some additional structure for the FFT analysis. These results compare favourably with the FFT analysis {\bf of} observations from carefully selected solar features, for example regions with pores. The results exhibit a significant shift of the frequency of these intensity oscillations from the period of the global $p$-mode oscillation represented in our simulations with a driver of period {\bf with} 5 minutes. Such shifts may be attributed to additional elasticity in the solar atmosphere resulting from the presence of a magnetic field {\bf or from non-linear processes}. 


 Closer inspection of the energy flux propagation results are indicative of enhanced energy flux propagation for increasing magnetic fields. The obtained periodic behaviour is confirmed by observational data, featuring similar frequencies based on the intensity times series of SDO images. The results of the FFT analysis exhibit a difference with the driver frequency. The frequency difference measured from the temporal analysis of the observational and simulation data is larger than would be expected from {\bf simple (e.g. linear) theory. }

They suggest that this is the result of the summation of energy deposition events in the solar atmosphere.

% Line 269. It is misleading mentioning the frequency shifts obtained by Hindman et al. (1996) because the current work does not have enough frequency resolution to detect such shifts. In addition, the physical mechanisms behind these shifts is not explained in the paper.
 
% Section 9. How long is the time series used in this work? Have the simulations achieve the stationary regime?
%Have the authors taken the part fo the time series in the stationary regime for the Fourier analysis? From what is shown in Figures like 9 and 10, this does not seem to be the case. Therefore, I do not understand how any conclusions about possible frequency shifts can be made from a time series of about 600 duration. This time series fits 2 wave periods, and part of the time is not in the stationary regime.
 
%END OF REFEREE COMMENT

Care must be taken with the measurement of the simulated frequency shifts and further work would investigate more fully the frequency shift mechanism. There are many possible mechanisms, one example could be a result of the superposition of waves arriving at different heights and times such a mechanism allows for the variation of the   magnetic field with location and time. Improved boundary conditions handling reflections from the upper boundary  may be required to run simulations for much longer time intervals. A further consideration may be a comparison of the results from the vertical tube with a model which is an improved representation of a solar pore \citet{Simon1970} \citet{Cameron2007}.

It is encouraging that the results presented here{\bf, even though the highly idealised approach,} are consistent with the behaviour exhibited  by earlier work. There is an issue that due to the extended nature of the driver the amplitudes used may be responsible for delivering vast quantities of energy into the solar atmosphere and for driving a highly numerically unstable system and inducing extremely large shocks \citet{Santamaria2015}. Significant improvements to the comparisons presented in this paper are expected with the  recent work of \citet{Kostogryz2021}. Here, modelling of intensity perturbations using a VALIIIc solar atmosphere model with radiative transfer the intensity oscillations perturbed by the solar global oscillations modelled using the ADIPLS code of \citet{Christensen-Dalsgaard2008}. Also, as described in \citet{Rast2016}, more sensitive observations with instruments such as DKIST may enable further constraints and the range of theoretical models. Future work will address simulation runs over longer time periods and for inclined fields.
