\section{Introduction}

Theoretical and computational studies coupled with observations from solar telescopes,  both from ground or space, reveal diverse structures and dynamics in the Sun's atmosphere. The~culmination of these studies of the  chromosphere and the upper solar atmosphere has enhanced our knowledge of the variety of magnetic field structures.  Despite our armoury of observations and the diverse range of computational models, it still remains a challenge to make sense of this complex menagerie of dynamic structures to understand solar atmospheric heating (i.e., chromospheric and coronal) and more generally, space weather~phenomena.


An example of the dynamical complexity are the ubiquitous five-minute oscillations in the  lower solar atmosphere  (i.e., in~particular in the photosphere) that are referred to as the solar global acoustic oscillations or $p$-modes. These global oscillations are interpreted as trapped acoustic waves, i.e.,~standing acoustic oscillations of the solar interior. Earlier models of these oscillations assumed that there was reflection by the photosphere with at most some small evanescent propagation above the photosphere. The~$p$-modes were interpreted as resonant modes trapped in a cavity formed from the steep change in density at the solar surface and a lower turning point in the interior caused by the increase in the speed of sound resulting in refraction. The~physical characteristics of the solar sub-surface layers can be estimated using observations of the standing modes.  There is now increasing evidence for leakage of these modes. %The complexity and variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere  give rise to a mixture of waves providing powerful diagnostics to aid our understanding and advance our knowledge  about these~structures.

   


%FIXME
%EXPLAIN IMPORTANCCE OF GLOBAL VERSUS LOCAL PHENOMENA HIGHLIGHT IN PAPER WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COUPLED ATMOSPHERE
%UPDATE
 The photosphere, chromosphere and transition layer act as a boundary layer coupling the solar interior and the solar corona. The~frequency shifts of global oscillations resulting  from boundary layers   and the influence of the coupling of the internal oscillations with the solar atmosphere have been investigated; see, e.g.,~the review~\cite{Erdelyi2006}.  A~number of earlier studies addressed the link between oscillations in the solar atmosphere and solar global oscillations;  this is also the topic of the computational modelling 
 %work 
\hl{study} 
described in this paper. An~outward propagating wave is reflected inward from the lower solar atmosphere, or~boundary layer, because~of a sudden decrease in the plasma density, while the lower boundary of the cavity is formed by the increasing sound speed due to temperature rises. For~global oscillation modes that exceed the acoustic cut-off frequency, there is wave leakage out from the cavity into the atmosphere. An~analytical model for understanding the behaviour of solar global oscillations based on the Klein--Gordon equation has been  developed~\cite{Taroyan2008}. This model suggests a global resonance. Waves  that are normally trapped by a frequency cut-off barrier are enhanced by a resonance enabling propagation into the upper solar atmosphere. The~inhomogeneous three-layer model leads to characteristic frequencies. Further work resulted in enhancements to the models described earlier~\cite{Pinter2007}.  This work utilised an exponentially decaying horizontal magnetic field as a representation of the magnetic carpet.  The~influence of the chromosphere-transition-corona boundary, the~relationship between magnetic structures and velocity wave perturbations had been the subject of a number of observational studies~\cite{Mein1976,Schmieder1980}. Some of these results indicate that small amounts of energy would propagate but that shock heating was unlikely to be a major source of coronal heating. Such studies were focused on the localised phenomena rather than on the global nature of the atmospheric~oscillations.
 
 For a number of decades, oscillations in the solar atmosphere have been the subject of observation and study, e.g.,~the reviews~\cite{Banerjee2011,deMoortel2009,Mathioudakis2013,Ruderman2009,Wang2011}. The~observed periods of atmospheric intensity oscillations range from  a few seconds to several hours~\cite{Auchere2014}. Much earlier, it was proposed by~\cite{Jensen1963}, that the 3- and 5-minute oscillations were the characteristics of the photosphere and the chromosphere. Recently, the~association of intensity oscillations with oscillations in coronal loops and sunspots has been confirmed for oscillation periods of three minutes. The~application of solar magneto-seismology (SMS) to intensity observations in the solar atmosphere can be used to understand the magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere, see, e.g.,~\cite{Roberts1984,Banerjee2007,Zaqarashvili2007,Erdelyi2008,Verth2010}.  Evidence for global oscillations  in the chromosphere and corona is suggested by the observational analysis of~\cite{Gyenge2018},  which demonstrates the frequent recurrence of micro-flare events with fluctuations between 3 min and 12 min. These fluctuations arise during time intervals before and after major solar~flares.


The key point of this %work
 \hl{study}  
is a comparison of numerical simulations  of a simplified solar atmosphere with observations, searching for a  potential link between ubiquitous upper atmospheric oscillations and the global solar oscillations. We use a  simple numerical representation that is of sufficient complexity to reveal the dominant dynamical processes in the magnetic solar atmosphere. Comparison of the reported observational work with the results of the modelling provides an indication that the modelling is sufficiently complex to give an insight into the physical mechanisms behind the behaviour of solar global oscillations. We report the results of numerical simulations of photospheric $p$-mode oscillations in a model solar atmosphere with a uniform and vertical magnetic field. We also present the results of a temporal analysis based on observations of intensity oscillations with the objective of providing evidence of the existence of the temporal behaviour exhibited by our simulations. The~work contributes to our understanding of the propagation and modification of global oscillations in the highly gravitationally stratified solar~atmosphere.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec2}
\label{sec:motivation}

Given the complexity of the dynamics and the diversity of structures in the solar atmosphere, it is understood that a truly realistic model is challenging and  requires a hybrid multi-disciplined approach. Many computational 
 \hl{magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)}  
simulations of the Sun have been undertaken, some of the approaches have resulted in an encouraging degree of realism~\cite{Vogler2005,Gudiksen2011}. Such approaches include thermal conduction and radiative transfer assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, and they employ an equation of state which accounts for partial ionisation.  Recently, quasi 
\hl{one-dimensional
(1D)}  
modelling of the hydrodynamics of a gravitationally stratified two component fluid was used to investigate the influence of energy dissipation through shock waves and collisional heating. The~model indicates that energy transport may be suppressed. Whilst the inclusion of a more accurate picture of ionisation and recombination may result in improved estimations of energy transport, this model does not address the issue of global phenomena~\cite{Zhang2021}. A~computational MHD simulation of the propagation of waves in 3D solar atmospheres, relevant to the present context, initially considered hydrodynamic models~\cite{Fedun2009a}.  In~later simulations, results were reported for magnetised solar atmospheres featuring an idealised flux tube~\cite{Fedun2009b,Vigeesh2012}. The~models with point drivers demonstrated the leakage of magnetoacoustic energy into the solar atmosphere. All these studies were applicable to local physics, e.g.,~waves in flux~tubes.   

In order to develop an improved model providing a representation of the solar atmosphere, it is necessary to establish that the modelling tools give a consistent behaviour in idealised test cases and that there is a consistency between the computational and theoretical models.  Following this principle, an~earlier 
 %work 
 \hl{study}  
tested the SMAUG \hl{(Sheffield MHD accelerated using graphical processing units)} %MDPI: defined as  met first in the main text. 
code with hydrodynamic models with drivers representing the standing $p$-mode oscillations, see~\cite{Griffiths2018b}. A~standing mode driver that does not possess any buffeting behaviour is placed just above the base of the computational model and mimics the evanescent $p$-mode oscillation. The~study does not consider non-linear effects because the driver employed is~linear.


%FIXME
%BUFFETING VERSUS VERTICAL MOTIONS USE THE WORD REALISTIC WITH CAUTION

%VERTICAL MOTIONS EXCITE ACOUSTIC MODES ONLY HOW ARE OTHER MODES EXCITED WHY STANDING MODE DRIVER WHY NOT A PROPAGATING DRIVER... THIS RELATES TO GLOBAL OSCILLATIONS HOW IMPORTANT ARE NON LINEAR EFFECTS... THIS IS UNCRERTAIN WOULD BE SUBJECT OF EXTENSION OF WORK

%UPDATE


Further, localised models reveal that vertical magnetic fields enable a leakage of energy to reach the corona, 
e.g.,~see~\cite{Khomenko2013,Santamaria2015}.   The %work of
 \hl{studies in Refs.}~\cite{Khomenko2013,Santamaria2015} reviewed and presented 2D computational MHD modelling of wave propagation in magnetic features such as sunspots and arcades.  In~all these simulations, atmospheric perturbations caused by photospheric global oscillations are represented using drivers located in the photosphere so as to mimic the influence of the solar $p$-modes. The~results of hydrodynamic modelling exhibited agreement  with the energy flux predictions from a two-layer analytical model based on the Klein--Gordon equation. This agreement supported the interpretation of the interaction between the solar atmosphere and the global oscillations. Furthermore, revealed by the simulations  was a consistency between power flux measurements 
from 
\hl{the Solar Dynamics Observatory 
(SDO)} 
and frequency dependent energy flux measurements from the numerical simulations. This observed propagation of energy into the mid-to-upper atmospheric regions of the 
\hl{quiet} %Quiet 
Sun occurred for a range of frequencies. Such observations may explain the observed intensity oscillations for periods greater than the 
 %well-
\hl{observed} %MDPI: "well/widely/etc-known/used/etc" not recommended for scientific papers. Please consider. MKG changed known to observed
5-minute and 3-minute oscillations. It was also found that energy flux propagation into the lower solar corona is strongly dependent on the particular wave modes. In~this paper, we present the results of investigation into the leakage of energy into the solar atmosphere using now 3D numerical MHD simulations with an extended driver representing solar global~oscillations. 







\section{Numerical Computation~Methods}


The simulations were undertaken using the SMAUG code, a~GPU \hl{(graphical processing unit)} 
implementation of the Sheffield Advanced Code (SAC) \cite{Shelyag2008}. 
The %~Sheffield MHD Accelerated Using GPUs (SMAUG) 
\hl{SMAUG} %MDPI: already defined above. 
\cite{Griffiths2015} and SAC  are derived from the versatile advection code (VAC) developed by~\cite{Toth1996}. SAC and SMAUG are numerical MHD solvers  that can be used to model the time-dependent evolution of photospheric oscillations in the solar atmosphere. The~SMAUG code can simulate linear and non-linear wave propagation in strongly magnetised plasma with structuring and~stratification.

\begin{equation}
p_{k}=\left(\gamma -1\right)\left(e-\frac{\rho {\mathbf v}^{2}}{2}-\frac{{\mathbf B}^{2}}{2}\right). \label{e6}

Assuming a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium of the background plasma, the~background quantities that do not change in time have a subscript $\it{b}$. The~temporally varying perturbed quantities do not have a subscript. The~fully non-linear MHD numerical finite element solver employs hyper-diffusion and hyper-resistivity to achieve numerical stability of the computed solution of the MHD equations \cite{Caunt2001}. A~more detailed description of the full set of MHD equations, including the hyper-diffusion source terms are given

we consider briefly the variety of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and address some of the oscillations that are 
observed in these regions. This is followed \hl{in Section 5} 
with a description of the solar atmospheric model, magnetic field configuration and the method used to  model global oscillations in a magnetic gravitationally stratified solar~atmosphere.
\section{Structures in the Solar~Atmosphere}

\label{sec:structures}



% The highly dynamic solar chromosphere exhibits numerous structures. Bright spots {\bf that} form in the trenches between solar granules are known as faculae, these features which are formed near magnetic field concentrations constantly form and dissipate over time scales of several minutes. Pores are a few Mm across and they are the smaller counterparts of sunspots, they are the bright areas near to and around sunspots or faculae. The bright areas that extend away from active regions are called plage regions.  The magnetic fields in this area diffuse away into the quiet Sun regions. The magnetic network is a network of lines which outline super-granules. Super-granules are convective regions about 30~Mm across, and they possess strong horizontal flows. The motions within the super-granules result in the concentration of bundles of magnetic field lines.  
%
%RE: i suggest to remove this: 
With the objective of constructing a simplified model of the solar atmosphere, we now  very briefly recall some of the structures which are  actually observed. Our initial computational studies were applicable to 
 %Quiet 
 \hl{quiet} 
Sun regions with magnetic fluxes in the range of 5--10 G, including the non-magnetic solar chromosphere and the quiet inter-network regions between the magnetic flux concentrations. Given the variety of solar atmospheric regions, for~example the network, inter-network, plage and faculae regions, it is recognised that the modes of oscillation with periods of 3 and 5 min exhibit varying behaviour. The~variation observed for different magnetic structures and reflecting layers such as the transition layer influences propagation in the upward and downward directions. The~mean photospheric field in the inter-network region is 100--300 G. 
%Solar active regions contain sunspots which have sizes between  1 - 50 Mm. 
 On the other hand, flare-producing

containing sunspots may have fields easily  exceeding the %normal 
range of 100--500 G. As~well as these massive concentrations, solar magnetograms reveal 
%many north poles in the quiet photosphere, this is known as 
 %that have sizes between  1 - 50 Mm, produce flares  that
 a weak-field component, known as the magnetic carpet. Whilst sunspots may be up to 50 Mm in diameter, solar pores are regions similar to sunspots but with considerably reduced sizes in the range 1--6 Mm. A~good discussion of the structure of  solar pores can be found in~\cite{Simon1970,Cameron2007}. The~features considered here are  schematically illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig1}, which exhibits a  variety of network loops with temperatures  that  can be in the range of $10^{5}$~K to $10^{6}$~K;

also shows the coronal funnels arising from the areas in-between the solar granules. The~ dynamic phenomena of concern in this paper result in  upward waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere. 
%The upward propagation of waves through the solar atmosphere can result in coronal heating, frequency shifts and other wave phenomena. A  spectrum of wave transformation  and interaction may occur including reflection and refraction by atmospheric structures.

\section{Computational~Model}
The hydrodynamic studies reported in~\hl{Ref.} 
\cite{Griffiths2018b} employed simulation drivers with physical characteristics representing $p$-mode oscillations with varying modes and periods. The~MHD simulations reported here use the same driver and model of the solar atmosphere as used in our initial hydrodynamic study. The~model is  advanced by the inclusion of a uniform, vertical and cylindrically symmetric magnetic~field. 

 The dimensions of the simulation box are $L_{ x}= 4$ Mm,  $L_{y} =4$ Mm and a height of $L_{z} =6$ Mm in the gravitationally stratified $z$-direction. The~computational box is an array of elements 
\highlighting{$128 \times128 \times128 $.} %MDPI: any units? MKG dimensionless number so no units  
The~upper boundary of the model is in the solar corona whilst the lower boundary is coincident with the photosphere. The~MHD code used here is suited to studying the propagation of wave energy from the photosphere, across the transition layer and leaking into the solar~corona. 
 
 %UPDATE
%INCLUDE DETAILS ABOUT THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS
The time scales relevant to our study are determined by the 5-minute $p$-mode oscillations; our approach employs boundary conditions allowing us to model induced wave propagation. To~generate these oscillations we use vertical velocity drivers  that are extended across the base of the computational domain. The~mechanism for handling the boundaries is crucial for maintaining the stability of a simulation over many cycles of the 
\highlighting{$p$}-mode 
oscillation. The~challenge is to reduce the reflectivity at the boundaries, in~particular, the~upper and lower boundaries. The~method utilised in these simulations attempts to minimise the gradients near the boundary. Since a central difference method is used to compute the gradients, variable values are copied from the mesh edge into two layers of ghost cells. These layers ensure that the discretization method can be applied over the whole mesh. The~net result of this approach is that any generated perturbation will be effectively propagated out of the computational domain. This type of boundary condition is referred to as an open boundary condition. In~what follows, we describe the model solar atmosphere and the driver employed.
 %UPDATE

Data obtained from solar observations were used to construct a semi-empirical model solar atmosphere, the~resulting model is a representation of the 
 %Quiet 
\hl{quiet} 
Sun. Employing the fundamental assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, the~VALIIIc model~\cite{Vernazza1981} was used to construct a model of 
the chromosphere in equilibrium. For~atmospheric heights greater than 2.5 Mm, the results from a model of solar coronal heating were used~\cite{McWhirter1975}. The~atmospheric profiles for temperature, density, sound speed and frequency cut-off for this model are shown in Figures~\ref{fig3} and~\ref{fig4}.

A further possibility for a model solar atmosphere is the use of the parametric approach; the~smoothed step function used %by
\hl{in Ref.}~\cite{Murawski2010} is an example. Discussion of the validity of model solar atmospheres and realistic models of the chromosphere  indicate the need for observationally derived semi-empirical models, see~\cite{Carlsson1995,Kalkofen2012}. It has been suggested that local dynamo action and joule heating in the dynamical solar chromosphere make the construction of models particularly challenging~\cite{Leenaarts2011}. The~latter aspects are not addressed further in the present~study.


Instead, for~the simulations described here, we use a simplistic model  that is uniform in the vertical ($z$) direction. The~cylindrically 
symmetric field was constructed using  the parametrisation in Equation~(\ref{e7}), the~effective cylinder radius was fixed at $R=0.14$ Mm.

%WHY A CYLINDRICAL FIELD?
A field configuration with vertical cylindrical symmetry is selected as this provides a working, e.g.,~rotational symmetry, representation for  the weaker intra-network magnetic field. The~choice of working geometry is a convenience when coding the MHD~equations.

%RE: if we have 50 G, that is far too weak for a pore. i siggest to delete this:
%a solar pore.    A good discussion of the structure of  solar pores can be found in \citet{Simon1970}, \citet{Cameron2007}.
Since the field is uniform in the vertical direction, the model atmosphere is in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. This was checked by ensuring that the initial configuration satisfies the magnetohydrostatic balance, for~an example see~\cite{Schussler2005,Gent2013}. We also explicitly tested that the there were no dynamic changes in the model due to a magnetohydrostatic imbalance. The~resulting density and temperature profiles are shown in Figure~\ref{fig3}. 


\section{Numerical Drivers for $p$-Mode~Oscillations}



The simulations, presented in this paper, employ an extended driver resulting in the perturbation of the entire lower boundary of the model.  The~photospheric $p$-mode oscillations  that are observed on the Sun have a horizontal wavelength and coherence. The~vertical velocity driver used here is an acoustic $p$-mode driver located at the photosphere and exciting waves which propagate into our realistic 3D model geometry of the solar atmosphere. An~extended driver with a sinusoidal dependence and a wavelength of 8~Mm applied along the middle of the base of a computational domain of dimension 4 Mm represents  a

%%\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\begin{equation}
 V_{z}  =  A_{nm} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_s} \right)\sin\left(  \frac{(n+1)\pi x}{L_x} \right)  
 \sin\left(\frac{(m+1)\pi y}{L_y} \right) \exp\left( -\frac{(z-z_0)^2}{\Delta z^2} \right). %,
\label{e8}
\end{equation}
%%\end{tabular}

For the  simulations here, a~$p$-mode driver corresponding to the 5-minute mode was used with period 300 s and mode (2,2) as an example. Earlier studies demonstrated the effectiveness of this mode with energy propagation, see~\cite{Griffiths2018b}. Simulations were run for different values of the magnitude of the magnetic field. The~mode numbers identified here are the $n$ and $m$ values in the expression for the driver shown in Equation~(\ref{e8}).

%FIXME
%DRIVER LOCATED IN THE PHOTOSPHERE WHY AT THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WHY NOT BELOW IDEALIZED EVANESCENCE NATURE OF SURFACE IS DYNAMIC










For the driver equation given in Equation~(\ref{e8}), $T_{s}$ is the period, $A_{nm}$ is the amplitude, the~indices $n$ and $m$ define the mode and the~lengths of the base of the simulation box in the $x$ and $y$ directions are $L_{x}$ and $L_{y}$, respectively. The~driver width, $\Delta z$ is set to $4$~km, the~parameter $z_{0}$ was set so that the vertical location of the driver is in the photosphere, 0.5 Mm above the lower boundary of the model and coincident with the location of the temperature minimum. The~simulations presented employ the parameter $A_{nm}$ = 500\, ms$^{-1}$ with the mode indices set to $n,m=2$. 


\section{Global Magnetoacoustic Waves in Uniform Vertical Magnetic Field~Configurations}

Magnetohydrodynamic simulations have been performed with $p$-mode oscillations of the photospheric layer and for magnetic field strengths of 0 G, 50 G, 75 G and 100~G. The plasma-$\beta$ was determined for the case with a magnetic field strength of 100 G. The~plasma-$\beta$ for the model decreases rapidly from a value of 50 at 0.7 Mm above the lower boundary of the simulation domain; $\beta$ is 1 at a height of 1.39 Mm.  
%It is anticipated that for the region with $\beta \approx 1$, mode conversion may occur. 

%FIXME

%%Vertically propagating acoustic waves in the vertical magnetic field cannot have mode conversion.

A set of videos of all the simulations that were performed can be obtained from the online research data archive hosted by The University of 
Sheffield %, \citet{Griffiths2018a} 
\highlighting{\cite{Griffiths2018a}} %MDPI: or "by Griffiths, ... " adding all three authors. 
 %{\bf RE: pls provide a direct weblink here. MKG the refernce is a working direct link}. 
 The videos display the evolution of the $z$-component of the plasma velocity along different layers of our model solar atmosphere. Each video shows the value of the vertical component of the plasma velocity ($z$-component in m/s) along different slices through the simulation box. Each video is labelled using the magnetic field strength in Gauss. Inspection of these results reveals that there are channels along which the vertical component of the plasma velocity is enhanced, and these are concentrated towards the central region of the simulation~box.
  %Figure 6 shows the normalised difference between the results for the 100G case and the 0G case. The normalisation is achieved by dividing the difference value  by the sum the sum of the values for the 0G and 100G case. The largest difference arises at the height where the velocity reverses direction.   



 
  
  %Our
 \hl{The} 
 results \hl{obtained} 
indicate that even a small magnetic field appears to enhance the motion of plasma in the low corona and  there is an apparent difference in phase between the magnetic field cases. As~well as an increase in the velocity amplitude with increasing magnetic field there is a small variation in the frequency of the oscillation. In~order to address  the observed variation in frequency, further investigative simulations would be required  that would include simulations running for a larger number of cycles.  The~key point here is that the background magnetic field is vertical, one may not accept any frequency variation assuming a linear wave evolution is the key component to the physics. Since the simulations do show small frequency variations, this may mean that that the linear theory may break.
  %For magnetic fields with strengths between $1$ kG and $50$ G, the theoretical prediction of \citet{Hindman1996} resulted in frequency shifts in the microhertz and nanohertz range.  Although this was a prediction of helioseismology, their result still provides insight into the mechanism of frequency shifts of waves in atmospheric magnetic structures.

%FIXME
%MENTION HERE WHY WE HAVE CUT THIS OFF AND REFERE TO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS OF REFLECTION

After much  effort implementing and testing  the chosen numerical scheme to solve the numerical equations, there are still reflections at the boundary; therefore, we consider the simulations to be valid up to the point where reflection occurs. Because~of this, the~simulations are cut after approximately 600~s of real time, corresponding to two period~cycles.

A  time--distance plot for the 300~s period driver, with~the

. The~reflections from the imperfect boundary conditions result in increased velocity amplitudes after a few oscillations. Although~we are investigating the propagation of waves into the corona, the~time--distance plots emphasise phenomena observed in the chromosphere and around the transition zone.  The~wave speeds measured from this time--distance plot are shown in Table~\ref{tab1}. A~comparison with the wave speeds computed from the model atmosphere suggests that the~speeds for the 0 G field are consistent with the speed of sound in the solar atmosphere, whilst the speeds for the non-zero magnetic field are consistent with propagation speeds for magnetosonic modes.
For a  vertical magnetic flux %tube 
with magnetic field strength $B_{0}$ and internal density $\rho_{0}$, comparisons with the measured wave speeds were computed using the following definitions:
the speed of sound,

The results indicate a variety of waves. Inspection of Figure~\ref{fig8} reveals excitation from the driver along with quasi-standing oscillations in the chromospheric cavity. There is also partial reflection of the signal at the boundary of the chromosphere and the transition layer. The~results also display evidence for signals propagating horizontally at the transition region and with frequencies similar to that of the driver. The~time--distance plot in Figure~\ref{fig7}, for~the 100~G case, exhibits reduced reflection at the transition layer, indicating energy leakage into the solar corona. Figure~\ref{fig7} shows an initial fast mode pulse followed by slow mode oscillations above the line which correspond to a plasma-$\beta$ with a value of one. Below~the height of 1~Mm, we observe quasi-standing mode oscillations along with oscillations of the magnetic field perturbations. Below~0.3~Mm, the~driver oscillations can be observed in conjunction with possible magnetoacoustic slow mode oscillations. Since the source terms perturb only the vertical component of the velocity and the model is cylindrically symmetric, pure Alfv\'en modes are not~expected.

The time--distance plots displaying the vertical component of the plasma velocity indicate significant differences in the propagation 
behaviour for the hydrodynamic and non-zero magnetic field cases. It is necessary to understand and quantify the extent of the energy 
leakage into the solar atmosphere. To~investigate the influence of the magnetic field on the propagation of wave energy we employ an 
expression for the energy flux which was used by~\cite{Bogdan2003}. The~wave energy flux

\begin{equation}
F_{\rm int}= \frac{1}{t_{\rm max}} \int_{0}^{t_{\rm max}} \int {\mathbf F}_{\rm wave} \cdot d{\mathbf A}dt,
\label{e11}
\end{equation}

These expressions are dependent on the perturbed kinetic pressure $\tilde{p}_{k}$. The perturbed variables are represented with a tilde  on top of the variable and a subscript $b$ for the background variables. 
%. %MDPI: Please expalin the tilde on top of the variables.
$$
\tilde{p}_{k}=\left(\gamma - 1\right)\left( \tilde{e}-\frac{ \left( \tilde{\rho} +\rho_b \right){\mathbf v}^2}{2}-\frac{{\mathbf B}^2}{2}\right).
$$


Using Equation~(\ref{e11}), we computed the energy flux integral for each of the drivers at different atmospheric heights and averaged over the total time. Next, we compute the ratio of this integrated energy flux to the integrated energy flux at the location of the driver. The~resulting values are shown in Table~\ref{tab2}. It appears that for heights greater than 4~Mm, the~energy flux is enhanced for increasing values for the vertical magnetic field. In~Figure~\ref{fig9},
%\ref{energyfluxratio_50G_75G_100G_line},
we plot the ratio of the integrated energy flux ratio for different values of the field at different heights and for the different vertical field values (the blue, orange, purple and red  are for field values of 0~G, 50~G, 75~G and 100~G, respectively). These plots demonstrate that for higher $B$-field magnitudes there is a small leakage of energy propagation. This latter finding is interesting because this is consistent with observations and other simulation results that demonstrate an enhancement for inclined~fields.

With the objective of confirming the obtained oscillatory behaviour, temporal analysis for the observational \hl{data}\cite{Pesnell2012}\cite{Lemen2012} %MDPI: please add the reference. MKG done 
was performed. We investigated intensity oscillations in the solar atmosphere observed by 
SDO/AIA  \hl{(Atmospheric Imaging Assembly).} 
The~passbands 1600 {\AA}, 1700 {\AA}, 304 {\AA}, 171 {\AA} and 193 {\AA} were selected because our simulation mainly focused on the lower atmospheric regions, i.e.,~photosphere, chromosphere and low corona. The~cadence of images is 24 s; therefore, it was suitable for studying relatively high-frequency oscillations such as the obtained $4$~mHz.

The initial magnetic field configuration of our model is a standing magnetic tube, passing through the chromosphere and the lower corona. 
The~selected area contains a small sunspot (e.g., a~solar pore), presumably featuring similar magnetic structure as our simulation. The~size 
of the investigated area covers 50 pixels in total between 18:00 UT to 20:00 UT on 22 August 2010. The~obtained time series shows 
non-stationary behaviour; therefore, the~observed linear trend is removed by taking the first difference $\Delta  y_{t}$ of the data. 
The~first difference is defined as the difference between consecutive observations $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-1}$. Furthermore, the~times series is

The results of the analyses are summarised in Table~\ref{tab3}. A~significant period is found with a frequency range of 3.5--4.2 mHz , corresponding a period range of $4.7$--$4$ min, which is close to the period found in simulation data. Another significant peak ($5$ mHz) is found with a period around $3$ min, which may be an indication of another global oscillation.  This randomly selected region in the solar surface suggests that the observed oscillation is a global~phenomenon.

\section{Discussion}
Whilst many studies focus on local wave phenomena, the~simulations and observational analysis reported here are attempting to address the global oscillations of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere into the low corona. These ubiquitous oscillations result in a small but detectable leakage of energy from the chromosphere  into the coronal regions of the solar atmosphere. It is worth noting that this energy may not be adequate to heat these regions to the observed temperatures. However, addressing the 
 %well-
 \hl{known}   
solar atmospheric plasma heating is not the main concern of this paper. Its purpose is to show that these global oscillations are present, and just like in the inner regions or for coronal loops, they may be explored for~magneto-seismology.

Early theoretical studies   considered wave propagation in idealised magnetic slab structures and demonstrated the fundamental conditions for  
 %magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) 
 \hl{MHD} %MDPI: already defined. 
wave propagation~\cite{Roberts1981a,Roberts1981b}. These models were soon advanced to cylindrical magnetic structures and addressed 
%the conditions under 
the different types of MHD waves sustained under the conditions of the solar corona~\cite{EdwinandRoberts1983}.  Investigation of the propagation of magnetoacoustic oscillations in an isothermal atmosphere with a vertical magnetic field resulted in the prediction of small frequency shifts of solar global internal or acoustic oscillations, see, e.g.,~\cite{Hindman1996}. The~analysis was unable to demonstrate the absorption of MHD waves,  for~example as observed in sunspots. Many of these  earlier studies  focused on the effect of magnetic flux tubes on wave propagation and neglected gravitational stratification. Much effort has been made to understand the role of solar atmospheric oscillations in coronal heating. Such modelling has ranged from one dimensional models modelling radiative energy loss to %Please check intended meaning is retained
  taking into account two fluid models of the plasma. Further work investigated the influence of vertical fields on a variety of modes, including $p$-mode oscillations in an isothermal stratified atmosphere~\cite{Hasan1992}. In~the limit of weak fields these results were used to analyse the spectrum of the modes of oscillation for the stratified~atmosphere.

\cite{Khomenko2013} considered localised wave phenomena and variation in different magnetic structures of the

Sun. For~example, in~the close proximity of the magnetic network elements, the~longer 5-minute modes propagate efficiently to the chromosphere. The~3-minute modes propagate from the photosphere to the chromosphere in the network cell interiors for restricted regions of the network and internetwork.  Observations show that the 3-minute modes exhibit enhancement in both the photosphere and the chromosphere, whereas the power of the 5-minute modes increases significantly in the chromosphere. These power enhancements are known as 
''halos'' and have been %widely

In contrast, the~work reported here is an extension of an earlier study representing photospheric $p$-mode oscillations using different point drivers~\cite{Malins2007}. These studies demonstrated  the generation of surface waves, structures in the transition zone and identified the effect of cut-offs induced by the stratified  solar atmosphere. The brief overview in Section~\ref{sec2} identified the physical phenomena of leaking energy into the lower solar atmosphere and the resulting oscillatory behaviour~there.

An initial study of global oscillations in a highly gravitationally stratified atmosphere looked at the variation of energy leakage with different modes of oscillation of an extended driver~\cite{Griffiths2018b}. The~investigation addressed an observational study indicating the ubiquitous nature of intensity oscillations. The~power spectra presented in

Furthermore, observed are the distinctive peaks for the short-period 3-minute waves (with frequencies in the range of 5--8 mHz). The~power spectra exhibit  peaks in much longer period ranges, for example 12-minute waves  (frequencies in the range 1.1--1.5 mHz)  and 16-minute waves (frequencies 1--1.1 mHz). For~the 
 %Quiet 
\hl{quiet} 
Sun regions the 5-minute modes are stronger at photospheric levels and diminished higher up in the corona; there is a small peak for the data from the AIA passband at 211 {\AA} corresponding to the corona at 2.0 MK.  The~computational results presented here corroborate the suggestion of~\cite{Didkovsky2013} of the existence of global oscillations in the solar corona. The~suggestion of small energy deposition events was indicated by~\cite{Ireland2015} in their study of power spectra of the solar corona. They suggest that this is the result of the summation of energy deposition events in the solar~atmosphere.



 



The remaining study 
%Please check intended meaning is retained
 focused on global oscillations of the solar atmosphere and employing extended drivers to emulate a driving \hl{p}-mode oscillation. The initial work with a hydrodynamic model was extended into an idealised model of a typical solar pore. Further, as~a test of ubiquity, the~observational analysis has been for randomly selected regions and the Fourier analysis for the observational results has been compared to a similar analysis for the simulated~feature.  








\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we have presented results for a series of MHD simulations of an extended oscillator at the base of a simple model solar atmosphere. A~comparison with observational data provides a unique insight into the nature of  global oscillations in the upper solar atmosphere caused by the ubiquitous \hl{p}-mode oscillation. It was found that the oscillations are enhanced by a vertical magnetic field. Although~the observational data suggest that the global atmospheric oscillations are detectable through oscillations in intensity, the~small energy leakage is not sufficient for heating of the solar corona; this is supported by the results of the~simulations.

We  have successfully extended the initial hydrodynamic model of global oscillations to test how the SMAUG~\cite{Griffiths2015} code works when our model atmosphere includes an initially symmetric and uniform magnetic field. Accelerated MHD codes such as SMAUG are a key requirement for simulations of magnetic and highly stratified plasma which are run for long time periods, for~example, for~models of the solar global oscillations. As~attempts are made to model large scale and more complex regions of the solar atmosphere, multiple graphical processing units will be~required.

The simulations with an extended driver show that the observed  solar atmospheric global oscillations are enhanced by regions with a vertical magnetic field. Investigation of the energy flux propagation results are indicative of the enhanced propagation of energy with increasing magnetic fields, but this is not sufficient to result in significant solar coronal heating. The~analysis suggests that the energy propagation is by magnetosonic modes. Due to the steep density changes around the transition region, slow and fast magnetosonic modes are responsible for reflecting some energy back to the chromosphere and the~photosphere.  

The FFT analysis of the simulated data demonstrated the presence of oscillations with periods in the range of 4.2--4.4 min. This arose for both the hydrodynamic case and the case with a magnetic field of 100~G. In~ the latter case there was some additional structure for the FFT analysis. There is a clear variation of the oscillation frequency around the 5~min period of the~driver. 

It is interesting that there is a similarity between the FFT analysis  of simulations and observations for different solar features, for~example for the 
 %Quiet 
 \hl{quiet} 
Sun or for regions with pores. The~results, derived from intensity time series of SDO images, also exhibit a significant variation of the oscillation frequency from the period of the global 5-minute oscillation.  The~frequency variation is larger than would be expected from  simple (e.g., linear) theory. Such frequency variations may be attributed to additional elasticity in the solar atmosphere resulting from the presence of a magnetic field, from~non-linear processes or from the artefacts of the observational method. This  may be understood in part by referring to 
 %the work of
\hl{Ref.}~\cite{Campbell1989}; however, in~their model the magnetic field was horizontal. An~explanation based on 
 the %work 
 \hl{study} of~\hl{Ref.}
\cite{Hindman1996} does not seem to explain the size of the frequency variations found in the~simulations.

 
  
  

%REFEREE COMMENT
% Line 269. It is misleading mentioning the frequency shifts obtained by Hindman~et~al. (1996) because the current work does not have enough frequency resolution to detect such shifts. In addition, the physical mechanisms behind these shifts is not explained in the paper.
 
% Section~9. How long is the time series used in this work? Have the simulations achieve the stationary regime?
%Have the authors taken the part fo the time series in the stationary regime for the Fourier analysis? From what is shown in Figures like 9 and 10, this does not seem to be the case. Therefore, I do not understand how any conclusions about possible frequency shifts can be made from a time series of about 600 duration. This time series fits 2 wave periods, and part of the time is not in the stationary regime.
 
%END OF REFEREE COMMENT
Care must be taken with the measurement of the simulated frequency variation, and further work is required to provide more insight into the different mechanisms. An~example could be a result of the superposition of waves arriving at different heights and times, such a mechanism allows for the spatio-temporal variation of the   magnetic field. Improved boundary conditions handling reflections from the upper boundary  will be required to run simulations for much longer time intervals and with inclined magnetic fields. A~further consideration may be a comparison of the results from the vertical tube with a model which is an improved representation of a solar pore~\cite{Simon1970,Cameron2007}.

It is encouraging that the results presented here are consistent with the behaviour exhibited by earlier \hl{studies}.

There is an issue that due to the extended nature of the driver, the~amplitudes are responsible for delivering vast quantities of energy into the solar atmosphere inducing extremely large shocks and result in a numerically unstable system~\cite{Santamaria2015}.
